![Course Project 1 Diagram](/img/ai_course_project_1.jpg)

In this project, students learn how to implement important AI concepts including:

1. **RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation):** Using text documents to improve a LLM models ability to provide answers
2. **Vector Databases:** How to split text and store for fast retrieval inside of your AI business application. 
3. **Large Language Models (LLM)**: How to augment LLM models with both RAG and the user's chat history (adding memory to an application)
4. **Streamlit Web Application**: How to package the business solution inside of a web application that can be used in production

## Development Environment For The AI Bootcamp

I'll provide the actual versions of software that I am running in my environment. This is important because the software is constantly changing and you may run into issues if you are using a different version of the software.

``` bash
conda env export --no-builds > environment_ds4b_301p_dev_matt.yml
```
